## Sophisticated Sorter

Extends the built-in container sorting functionality of the Sophisticated series to work on the player inventory and all usable containers.

### Main Features

This mod adds the two sorting buttons from Sophisticated Core to all container GUIs. These buttons trigger the sorting functionality from Sophisticated Core.

There are four sorting modes: by Name, by Mod, by Quantity, and by Tags. The default mode is by Name. One of the buttons is used to cycle through the available sorting modes.

Container filtering is enabled by default. Only containers with more than 46 slots (Player Inventory 36 + Container 10) will have their contents sorted. In other cases, the player's inventory will be sorted.

For example, both the survival mode inventory and the crafting table have 46 slots, so clicking the button sorts the player's inventory. Containers like Barrels and Chests, which have more slots, will have their contents sorted instead.

The sort buttons will not appear for containers that cannot be sorted themselves. However, the player can still sort their inventory using the hotkey (default: R) in any container GUI.

The hotkey works in any container GUI, but whether it sorts the container or the player's inventory follows the same rules as the buttons.

If you need to sort containers with 10 slots or fewer, you can disable the container filter in the configuration file.

This mod only extends the sorting functionality of Sophisticated Core to other containers; it does not add any sorting logic itself and will not include additional unrelated features in the future.

Containers from the Sophisticated series can only use the sorting function from Sophisticated Core, otherwise stack upgrades will not work properly.

For players accustomed to the Sophisticated series, you can now use a unified sorting system throughout the entire game!

### Future Plans

-   Customizable container filtering.
-   Customizable button position.
-   Container search and transfer of Sophisticated Core.
